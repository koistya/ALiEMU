It encodes the source fragment, initial variables, and\n * a mapping from variables in the composing query's (or fragment's) scope to\n * variables in the fragment's scope.\n *\n * The variable mapping is represented by `variableMapping`, a dictionary that\n * maps from names of variables in the parent scope to variables that exist in\n * the fragment. Example:\n *\n * ```\n * // Fragment:\n * var Container = Relay.createContainer(..., {\n *   initialVariables: {\n *     private: 'foo',\n *     public: 'bar',\n *     variable: null,\n *   },\n *   fragments: {\n *     foo: ...\n *   }\n * });\n *\n * // Reference:\n * ${Container.getQuery(\n *   'foo',\n *   // Variable Mapping:\n *   {\n *     public: 'BAR',\n *     variable: variables.source,\n *   }\n * )}\n * ```\n *\n * When evaluating the referenced fragment, `$public` will be overridden with\n * `'Bar'`. The value of `$variable` will become the value of `$source` in the\n * outer scope. This is analagous to:\n *\n * ```\n * function inner(private = 'foo', public = 'bar', variable) {}\n * function outer(source) {\n *   inner(public = 'BAR', variable = source);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Where the value of the inner `variable` depends on how `outer` is called.\n *\n * The `prepareVariables` function allows for variables to be modified based on\n * the runtime environment or route name.\n */\n\nvar RelayFragmentReference = (function () {\n  RelayFragmentReference.createForContainer = function createForContainer(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables) {\n    var reference = new RelayFragmentReference(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables);\n    reference._isContainerFragment = true;\n    return reference;\n  };\n\n  function RelayFragmentReference(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, RelayFragmentReference);\n\n    this._initialVariables = initialVariables || {};\n    this._fragment = undefined;\n    this._fragmentGetter = fragmentGetter;\n    this._isContainerFragment = false;\n    this._isDeferred = false;\n    this._isTypeConditional = false;\n    this._variableMapping = variableMapping;\n    this._prepareVariables = prepareVariables;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Mark this usage of the fragment as deferred.\n   */\n\n  RelayFragmentReference.prototype.defer = function defer() {\n    this._isDeferred = true;\n    return this;\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Mark this usage of the fragment as conditional on its type.\n   */\n\n  RelayFragmentReference.prototype.conditionOnType = function conditionOnType() {\n    this._isTypeConditional = true;\n    return this;\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Mark this fragment for inclusion only if the given variable is truthy.\n   */\n\n  RelayFragmentReference.prototype['if'] = function _if(value) {\n    var callVariable = QueryBuilder.getCallVariable(value);\n    !callVariable ? process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? invariant(false, 'RelayFragmentReference: Invalid value `%s` supplied to `if()`.

If\n *    this is the initial mount (with no existing view), renders to null.\n *\n * In addition, supplying a `renderLoading` that returns undefined has the same\n * effect as not supplying the callback. (Usually, an undefined return value is\n * an error in React).\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by any of these callbacks can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...data} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted.
